Maintainence Management System

The maintainence management system is a software designed using Flask in which different users can file up any request reagarding any maintainence required for their home.
The initial software was set up using VB.NET which restricts the software to just a single user, but the implementation using Flask enables it to be a multi user software.
There isn't any additional software require for an admin end because the admin priviledges are supported in the software itself.

The software capabilities are :-
1. Users can create their own account
2. Users can login using their own account
3. Users can file for any maintainence request
4. Users can view their Pending or Completed Requests
5. An admin can view how many accounts are registered in the software
6. An admin can view total requests set up on the database
7. An admin can mark any job as Completed or Pending
